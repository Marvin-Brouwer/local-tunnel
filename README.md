# @local-tunnel

TODO: better readme

## Development

The solution is setup to watch with a single command.  
To get started, run `pnpm i` on the project root.  
Next, run `pnpm watch` on the project root, and all workspaces will start watching for changes and compiling libraries.  

Individual libraries will have documented cli commands to host and test the tunnel.  
For setting up a local server see: [~/libs/server](./libs/server/Readme.md).  
For connecting to a local-tunnel server see: [~/libs/server](./libs/cli/Readme.md).
