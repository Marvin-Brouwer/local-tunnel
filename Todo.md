# TODO

## Copy over contribution docs

Copy over contribution docs and github templates from other projects.
Possibly, change some stuff to conventional commits for autogenerating release notes.

## Setup test pipelines in github

All tests should be run on PR to prevent breaking merges.

## Setup semantic release/release me

We don't want to be releasing to npm manually, use one of those setups to make the releases less painful than the original package.
