# @local-tunnel/client

TODO: Write better readme.

## Usage

TODO: Write configuration help.

## Testing

To test this library it's probably best to `pnpm watch` this workspace and and test the [~/libs/cli](../cli/Readme.md) package against a local [~/libs/server](../server/Readme.md).  

## TODO's

Some tasks can use further exploration.  

## Figure out client disconnect

For some reason the tunnels seem to disconnect. Figure out what's different between this setup and the original package.  
Current workaround: keepalive interval.
